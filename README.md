# HumanHomes

Democratize homeownership. Full real estate operating system for homeowners — no agents, no gatekeeping, no middlemen.

## What is HumanHomes?

HumanHomes is a platform that gives every homeowner the full power of the real estate industry without needing a realtor. Buyers find homes to live in — not invest in. Sellers choose who gets to call their house a home. Communities verify their own.

### The Problem

- Realtors gatekeep communication between buyers and sellers
- MLS locks market data behind professional memberships
- Corporate buyers and flippers treat homes as financial instruments
- The human story of a home is lost in the transaction

### The Solution

A platform where:
- **Sellers tell their home's story** — not just beds and baths, but the crow that delivered newspapers and the porch where memories were made
- **Buyers share who they are** — families and people who will actually live there, verified by their communities
- **Everyone gets the tools** — comps, pricing guidance, offer management, disclosure templates, closing coordination — all free, no agent required
- **Communities verify their own** — multi-layer verification ensures homes go to real families, not flippers
