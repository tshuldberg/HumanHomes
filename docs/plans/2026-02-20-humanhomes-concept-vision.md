## The Core Idea

Stop people from profiting on single-family homes. Return them to what they are: living spaces. Build communities where people care about where they live, care about their homes, and know their neighbors.

**Buyers** are buying to have a home to live in — not to turn a profit.

**Sellers** want to sell to families or people who will actually live in the home — not to flippers or companies that will use it for profit.

Put the buyer and the seller back in the driver seat. They've been pushed out of that position, and they shouldn't be.

## What's Broken

### Realtors Block Human Connection

The current system puts two realtors between buyer and seller and won't let them talk. Buyers can't ask sellers about the home — "What did you do here? Why this?" — because the realtors control the communication. But homes aren't transactions. They're part of your life. They're living entities. They get fixed up, they degrade, they have a story. You live with a home.

The personal side of a home matters. A previous owner who sat on the front porch feeding a bird by hand. A crow that would deliver the newspaper. Those stories exist, but the system buries them. HumanHomes brings them forward.

### Inspectors Work for the Wrong People

Home inspectors often have realtor affiliations. They work for the realtor, not the buyer. They gloss over problems because they want the realtor to make the sale. Buyers catch things inspectors miss because the inspector isn't working for them.

HumanHomes requires inspectors with no realtor affiliation. They work for the buyer, period.

### No One Can Afford to Buy Alone

Individual buyers are priced out. Friends talk about it constantly: none of them can buy individually, but two or three of them together could. That's the most realistic path to homeownership for a lot of people — sharing a mortgage, living in a home together. The current system has no tools for that.

### Corporate Buyers Destroy Communities

Companies like BlackRock own massive numbers of homes. They treat single-family houses as financial instruments. McDonald's has been a landlord for 50 years, not a burger business — real estate is buried in corporate strategy everywhere. People are locked into subscription-based lifestyles (renting), and companies are trying to subscription-ize everything else too. People don't want that. There needs to be an exit ramp.

### The Boomer Gap

Baby boomers hold a massive share of housing stock. Many aren't downsizing. Many couldn't afford repairs, so homes are sitting with deferred maintenance. Some don't have children or next of kin. When they pass, their homes get sold on the open market to whoever — often flippers or corporate buyers. There's no smooth mechanism to transition these homes to families who will actually live in them.

## Key Features

### 1. People Profiles — It's About the People

Seller profiles and buyer profiles. Not just the home — the people. The thing about buying a home is that the relationship between the seller and the buyer matters, but the current system erases it entirely. HumanHomes makes it central.

- **Buyer profiles:** Who are you? What's your family? Why this neighborhood?
- **Seller profiles:** What did you love about this home? Why are you selling? What's the story?

The home is about the people as much as the property.

### 2. Neighborly Verification

The hardest challenge: how do you verify that a buyer is actually a family that's going to live there?

One approach: a **neighborly verification system**. Someone you've lived next to or lived with vouches for you — confirms that you're a real person, a real family, and you actually live where you say you live.

This is community-based trust, not institutional trust. Your neighbors verify you, not a bureaucracy.

### 3. Direct Buyer-Seller Communication

Remove the realtor wall. Let buyers and sellers talk directly. Let the buyer ask about the home's history. Let the seller know who's buying their home. Real human connection between the people involved in one of the biggest decisions of their lives.

### 4. Inverted Professional Model

Flip the traditional model. Instead of buyers going to a realtor or sellers going to a broker, **the professionals come to you**. A broker says, "Hey, can I help you connect?" instead of a buyer saying, "Hey, can you connect me with this house?"

The people make the first connection. Then they decide what professional help they want — if any.

There's no requirement to have a realtor anymore. The services a realtor provides — documentation, making sure everything is tidy, connecting the right people — those services can be fully provided within the platform.

Revenue comes from professionals who want to participate, not from users who are forced to use them.

### 5. Group & Collective Purchasing

Multiple people pooling resources to buy a home together. Friends who can't afford to buy individually but could do it as a group of two or three. Living together, sharing a mortgage, building ownership together.

This could evolve from the rental side too: renters who live together already could come together and purchase the home from the landlord. Move from renters to co-owners. That's a realistic path to homeownership for people who otherwise have none.

### 6. Community Filters (Private)

Some communities want to connect with each other. Catholics might want to sell to Catholics. People with certain lifestyles might want to find neighborhoods that share their values. That's OK — those communities already form naturally.

But the filters should be **private**. Users control what they see. Preferences are never visible to others. No one gets targeted, no one gets excluded visibly. People just find what they're looking for.

### 7. Boomer Home Transition

Baby boomers without heirs often have financial advisors, money managers, accountants, bookkeepers — people who handle their affairs. When they're drawing up a trust or a will, there should be an option: "You don't have an heir. Your home will be sold when you die. Would you like to make sure it's sold to a family that's actually going to live in it?"

This means connecting with the professionals who manage these estates — making them aware of HumanHomes as an option. Not standard marketing channels, but the people who are already in the room when end-of-life decisions are being made.

There could be a division of the business focused on **holding homes during transition** — facilitating the period between when a boomer passes and when the right buyer is found. Acting as an intermediary to make sure the home ends up with a family, per the homeowner's wishes.

### 8. Community-Based Profit Distribution

When a home transitions and generates revenue, instead of that money flowing to corporate entities, it could flow back into the community where the home sits. A community forum where neighbors help decide where the proceeds go — a local park, a walkable space, a subsidized corner market, a scholarship program.

Instead of corporations profiting off property value, the community profits. People invest in their own neighborhoods because they benefit from them directly.

## The Anti-Cookie-Cutter Philosophy

Neighborhoods should have character. Yards should exist — places where kids can play, where food can grow, where fruit trees produce lemons that little girls come by with bags to collect. That's a real human interaction that everyone benefits from, and it doesn't exist in cold, dense, maximized developments.

The corporate development model looks at a 3-acre lot with one house and sees room for six houses with no yards. No space to grow food. Kids can't play outside. You drive to the park, drive everywhere. That approach maximizes profit but destroys community.

HumanHomes celebrates the wild yard over the manicured nothing-yard. Character over cookie-cutter. Community gardens and fruit trees over developer density metrics. Neighborhoods like Santa Barbara where every house has personality, where the quirks are in every block — not subdivisions where everything looks the same.

## Entry Point & UX Challenge

If a user enters the app and sees a wide selection of homes, then provides their info and watches the list shrink — that feels bad. "Why did it shrink? Because I'm not that?" That's a problem.

The entry point needs to be inviting. Some preferences should be private. There shouldn't be an expectation of disappointment or a feeling of being filtered out. How this works exactly is an open design question — possibly cross-pollinating from dating apps or community platforms that handle preference-matching without creating rejection dynamics.

## Growth Strategy

### Grassroots Revolution

This has to be a swell from average people. A ground-up movement of users cutting out middlemen. Until it impacts the financials of entrenched players in a meaningful way, none of the pressure — political, regulatory, or otherwise — will even register as a blip to companies like BlackRock.

The path is: enough people start using the service and cutting out middlemen from the process. That's when the industry pays attention.

### Delicate Positioning

You're taking power and wealth from some of the largest industries on the planet and redistributing it. That requires a delicate line. Move too aggressively and they'll stomp on it — financial pressure, political pressure. But if the groundswell is real, if people are behind it, that's how it works. You can inspire brokers, you can inspire people, and maybe even a few "cool billionaires" who want to loan and invest in a more communal, socialized way.

### Legislative Path (Long-Term)

Eventually, legislation is needed. Businesses can't own all the homes — it's not sustainable. There will need to be laws. But you can't lead with that. The grassroots support has to come first, and then the people convince the legislators. The platform provides the proof that a different model works.

### Inspiring Change

The service doesn't just transact — it inspires. It can inspire brokers to change how they operate. It can inspire investors to think differently. It can show that community-driven homeownership is viable, and that homes don't need to be financial instruments.

## Revenue Without Exploitation

Any revenue the platform generates should come from the interest of realtors and brokers — professionals who want to participate, not users who are forced to pay. The platform provides the services that a realtor would. Professional help is optional and on the user's terms.

For the estate transition space, there's a model where the platform holds homes during the transition period and a dedicated team ensures the homeowner's wishes are honored. Revenue from that holding period stays small and mission-aligned — or flows back into the community through charitable distribution decided by the local neighborhood.

This is capitalism's money, but disseminated differently. Used for community projects, scholarship programs, walkable spaces, subsidized local businesses — whatever the community decides.

## Summary

HumanHomes exists to make single-family homes about living again. Homes where people know their neighbors. Homes with stories. Homes where the yard has fruit trees that strangers come by and ask if they can pick from. Homes where the previous owner's personality is part of the house's identity.

The platform gives buyers and sellers the tools they need without forcing them through gatekeepers. It verifies intent through community, not institutions. It creates paths to ownership for people who've been locked out. And it treats every home as what it is: a living space, not a financial instrument.
