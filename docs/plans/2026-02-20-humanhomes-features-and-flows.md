## UX Design Considerations & Open Questions

### Entry Point UX (Critical — Unsolved)

**The Problem:** If users see a large inventory of homes and then watch it shrink after providing personal details, the experience feels exclusionary. "Why did it shrink? Because I'm not that?"

**Explored Approaches:**
1. **Progressive disclosure** — Show results gradually as profile builds, never show-then-remove
2. **Preference-first onboarding** — Collect preferences before showing any listings
3. **Private filtering** — Some filters operate invisibly; no "before/after" count visible
4. **Warm onboarding** — Lead with stories and community discovery, not property search
5. **Cross-pollination** — Study dating apps, community platforms, social networks for how they handle preference-matching without rejection dynamics

**Open Questions:**
- Which approach best balances personalization with inclusivity?
- Can we A/B test these during beta?
- Is there a hybrid approach (e.g., warm onboarding that naturally collects preferences)?

### Private Filters vs Public Discovery

**Design Tension:** Users want to filter by personal values and community preferences (religion, lifestyle, interests), but making these filters visible creates exclusion dynamics.

**Current Decision:** Filters are always private. The user controls what they see. Their preferences are never visible to sellers or other users.

**Open Questions:**
- How do we handle the case where a seller has strong preferences about who buys their home? Is that a private preference too?
- Do private filters create a "shadow discrimination" problem, even if invisible?
- Should there be categories of filters that are always private vs. optionally visible?

### Meet-and-Greet Features

**Status:** Not yet designed. The transcript flagged concern about meet-and-greet features creating gatekeeping dynamics (sellers screening buyers in person before accepting offers).

**Open Questions:**
- Is there a way to facilitate personal connection without enabling discrimination?
- Should video calls be available only after an offer is submitted?
- Does the verification system + Home Story + buyer profile provide enough human connection without a formal meet-and-greet?

### Group Purchasing UX

**Challenge:** Group buying is novel for most people. The UX needs to make an unfamiliar process feel achievable.

**Open Questions:**
- How do we present co-ownership complexity (legal structures, exit clauses) without overwhelming users?
- Should group formation be a separate flow or integrated into the main search experience?
- How do we handle the case where one group member fails verification?
- What happens when a group disagrees during the offer/negotiation process?

### Boomer Transition UX

**Challenge:** Sensitivity and respect for aging homeowners who may not be tech-savvy.

**Open Questions:**
- Should there be a simplified interface for transition listings?
- Can family members create listings on behalf of aging homeowners?
- How do we handle estate transitions where the homeowner has passed?
- Should the repair network be a standalone feature accessible outside the selling context?

### Anti-Cookie-Cutter Philosophy in UX

**Principle:** The platform celebrates neighborhood character, yard space, fruit trees, and walkability over density and uniformity.

**Design Implications:**
- Listing templates should prompt for yard features, community elements, and neighborhood character
- Search filters should include "yard size," "walkability," "community gardens," and "neighborhood character" — not just beds/baths/price
- Neighborhood discovery should surface character-rich areas, not just high-value ones
- Visual design should feel organic and warm, not corporate and sterile
